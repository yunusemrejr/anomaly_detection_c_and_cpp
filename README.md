# 📊 Anomaly Detection Software

Welcome to **Anomaly Detection Software**! This lightweight tool leverages statistical methods to identify outliers in numerical datasets. Its main goal is to help you detect unusual or abnormal data points with minimal setup.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📈 Statistical Approach**: Utilizes fundamental statistical methods for anomaly detection.
- **🔍 Normal Distribution Assumption**: Assumes your data follows a normal distribution.
- **📏 Mean and Standard Deviation Based**: Detects anomalies based on deviations from the mean.
- **⚙️ Configurable Threshold**: Preconfigured to 2 standard deviations, but can be customized as per your needs.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide an array of float values.
2. **Calculations**:
   - Computes the **mean** and **standard deviation** of the dataset.
   - Flags data points that fall outside 2 standard deviations from the mean.
3. **Output**: A 2D array where each row contains:
   - The original value
   - A flag (`1.0` for anomaly, `0.0` for normal)

## 📚 Use Cases

- **🏭 Quality Control**: Identify defective products in manufacturing processes.
- **💰 Financial Analysis**: Spot unusual transactions or market behaviors.
- **🌍 Environmental Monitoring**: Detect abnormal sensor readings.
- **🛡️ Network Security**: Identify suspicious network traffic patterns.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Assumption of Normality**: Assumes data follows a normal distribution, which may not hold true for all real-world datasets.
- **Fixed Threshold**: The default threshold of 2 standard deviations may not suit every dataset.
- **Single-Variable Focus**: Designed for univariate data, not complex multivariate patterns.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

This software is designed as a **foundation** for anomaly detection. It can be extended and refined for specific use cases, including:
- **Multivariate Data Handling**
- **Dynamic Thresholding**
- **Integration with Machine Learning Models**
